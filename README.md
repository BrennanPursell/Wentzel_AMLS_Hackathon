## Questions

## Introduction

Did you ever wonder how computer vision AI really works under-the-covers? In this workshop we will look at a real computer vision use case for a REAL company. Then we'll break apart the solution and show you how to develop it.  Scattered throughout the workshop we'll learn the theory behind the implementation and show you how to develop DevOps pipelines to deploy the solution. 


A laptop and an active Azure subscription are required in order to work through the labs. You will want to make sure you have the appropriate set of rights in that subscription to instantiate the services that you will be working with. Let me know if you have any questions about these requirements.

## Scenario
